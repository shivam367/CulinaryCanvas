### 3.5. üìå Data Flow & Backend

#### 3.5.1. ü§ñ AI Model Integration (Current Setup)
*   **Core AI Engine**: Genkit framework (`src/ai/genkit.ts`).
*   **Language Models**: Configured to use Google Gemini models (e.g., `googleai/gemini-2.0-flash` as specified in `src/ai/genkit.ts`).
*   **Current Usage**: The Genkit infrastructure is set up, but no specific AI-driven features are currently implemented for the end-user. Form submissions (feedback, reservations, orders) are handled client-side and log data to the console for demonstration.

#### 3.5.2. ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Services (Relevant to Genkit)
*   **Google AI Platform**: Utilized via the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin for accessing Gemini models. Requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the environment for any potential Genkit operations.

#### 3.5.3. üîí User Data Management
*   **Theme Preference**: Stored client-side in the browser's `localStorage`.
*   **Form Submissions (Reservations, Orders, Feedback)**: Currently, data is handled client-side.
    *   Input data is collected using React Hook Form.
    *   On submission, data is logged to the console (simulating a backend call).
    *   Mock success messages are displayed to the user.
    *   The feedback form updates a client-side list of (mock) recent reviews.
*   **No Persistent User Accounts**: The application does not currently feature user registration or login.
*   **No Server-Side Database for User Data**: Order history, reservation details, and feedback are not persistently stored on a server.

### 3.6. ‚öôÔ∏è UI Components & Design Patterns

#### 3.6.1. üß© Key UI Components Used (ShadCN UI & Custom)
*   **Layout & Navigation**: `Navbar`, `Footer`, `ThemeProvider`, `Sheet` (Mobile Menu), `Link` (Next.js).
*   **Content Display**: `Card` components, `Alert`, `Image` (`next/image`), `StarRatingDisplay`, `Badge`, `Separator`, `Tabs`.
*   **Forms & Input**: `Form` (React Hook Form), `Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `Calendar`, `Popover`, `Select`, `RadioGroup`, `StarRatingInput`.
*   **Interaction & Feedback**: `Dialog` (Order Checkout), `Toaster`.
*   **Custom Shared Components**: `Logo`, `SectionWrapper`.

#### 3.6.2. üé® Theming & Styling Approach
*   **Dark/Light Mode**: Managed by `ThemeProvider` toggling a `.dark` class.
*   **CSS HSL Variables**: Defined in `src/app/globals.css` for themes.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for all utility-first styling.
*   **`cn` Utility**: For merging Tailwind classes.

## 4. Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Culinary Canvas up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Environment Variables

If you plan to experiment with Genkit (even though it's not driving features currently), a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is typically required:

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  Add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivam367/CulinaryCanvas.git
    cd CulinaryCanvas
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

1.  Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  If you intend to use or develop Genkit AI flows in the future, you can start the Genkit development server in a separate terminal (optional for current functionality):
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This usually starts on `http://localhost:4000` (Genkit UI) and `http://localhost:3400` (Genkit API).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command bundles the application for production. You can then start the production server using `npm run start`.

## 5. Project Structure

A brief overview of the key directories:

*   `src/app/`: Contains all the Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
    *   `(default)/`: Layout for main application pages (if used, currently pages are in root or specific route groups).
    *   `blog/`, `contact/`, `feedback/`, `menu/`, `order/`, `reservations/`: Route groups for specific pages.
    *   `globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS theme variables.
    *   `layout.tsx`: Root layout for the entire application.
    *   `page.tsx`: Homepage.
*   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
    *   `layout/`: Components related to overall page structure.
    *   `sections/`: Components specific to sections of a page.
    *   `shared/`: General-purpose shared components.
    *   `ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions, constants, type definitions (`constants.ts` contains mock data).
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
*   `src/ai/`: Genkit AI integration setup (`genkit.ts`, `dev.ts`). The `flows/` directory is conventional for Genkit flows but is currently empty.
*   `public/`: Static assets like images (`public/media/` contains application images).
*   `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration.
*   `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind CSS configuration.
